The local filters, which follow the structure of the extended Kalman filter, are implemented in each system, which estimates its own state exclusively. To be suitable for the heavily restricted implementation to very large-scale systems, a novel algorithm is proposed, which: (i) does not rely on instantaneous data transmission; (ii) allows local communication exclusively; and (iii) requires computational, memory, and data transmission resources for each system that do not scale with the dimension of the network. The scalability of the proposed algorithm allows for its application to the cooperative localization problem of very large-scale systems. In particular, it is applied herein to the on-board position estimation problem of LEO mega-constellations using GNSS featuring numerical simulations for the Starlink constellation.},

	abstract = {Within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested users can lead to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum which could be achieved by centrally controlling the users' choices. In this paper, we design a fair incentive mechanism to steer the selfish behavior of the users to align with the societally optimal aggregate routing. The proposed mechanism is based on an artificial currency that cannot be traded or bought, but only spent or received when traveling. Specifically, we consider a parallel-arc network with a single origin and destination node within a repeated game setting whereby each user chooses from one of the available arcs to reach their destination on a daily basis. In this framework, taking faster routes comes at a cost, whereas taking slower routes is incentivized by a reward. The users are thus playing against their future selves when choosing their present actions. To capture this complex behavior, we assume the users to be rational and to minimize an urgency-weighted combination of their immediate and future discomfort. To design the optimal pricing, we first derive a closed-form expression for the best individual response strategy. Second, we formulate the pricing design problem for each arc to achieve the societally optimal aggregate flows, and reformulate it so that it can be solved with gradient-free optimization methods. Our numerical simulations show that it is possible to achieve a near-optimal routing whilst significantly reducing the users' perceived discomfort when compared to a centralized optimal but urgency-unaware policy.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a time-invariant network flow model capturing two-person ride-pooling that can be integrated within design and planning frameworks for Mobility-on-Demand systems. In these type of models, the arrival process of travel requests is described by a Poisson process, meaning that there is only statistical insight into request times, including the probability that two requests may be pooled together. Taking advantage of this feature, we devise a method to capture ride-pooling from a stochastic mesoscopic perspective. This way, we are able to transform the original set of requests into an equivalent set including pooled ones which can be integrated within standard network flow problems, which in turn can be efficiently solved with off-the-shelf LP solvers for a given ride-pooling request assignment. Thereby, to compute such an assignment, we devise a polynomial-time algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. an approximated version of the problem. Finally, we perform a case study of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA, where we quantify the effects that waiting time and experienced delay have on the vehicle-hours traveled. Our results suggest that the higher the demands per unit time, the lower the waiting time and delay experienced by users. In addition, for a sufficiently large number of demands per unit time, with a maximum waiting time and experienced delay of 5 minutes, more than 90% of the requests can be pooled.},

The problem is tackled in a novel moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework, while taking into account the limited communication capabilities and the restricted computational power and memory, which are distributed across the network. The proposed design is motivated by the fact that, in a decentralized setting, a Luenberguer-based framework is unable to leverage the full potential of the available local information. A method is derived to solve a relaxed version of the resulting optimization problem. It can be synthesized offline and its stability can be assessed prior to deployment. It is shown that the proposed approach allows for significant improvement on the performance of recent Luenberger-based filters. Furthermore, we show that a state-of-the-art distributed MHE solution with comparable requirements underperforms in comparison to the proposed solution.},

A general scheme is proposed, in which the problem is formulated as a classical linear quadratic regulator problem, for the global system, subject to a given sparsity constraint on the gain, which reflects the decentralized nature of the network. A method able to compute a sequence of well-performing stabilizing regulator gains is presented and validated resorting to simulations of two randomly generated LTV systems, one stable and the other unstable. Moreover, a tracking solution is developed, building on the solution to the regulator problem. Both methods rely on a closed-form solution, thus they can be computed very rapidly. Similarly to the centralized solution, both the presented methods require that a window of the future system dynamics is known. Both methods are validated resorting to simulations of: (i) a nonlinear network of four interconnected tanks; and (ii) a large-scale nonlinear network of interconnected tanks. When implemented to a nonlinear network, approximated by an LTV system, the proposed methods are able to compute well-performing gains that track the desired output.

	keywords = {Decentralized Control, Distributed Robot Systems, Networked Control, Space Robotics, Autonomous Agents, Mega-constellations},
	abstract = {The advantages and tremendous potential of very large-scale complex networks of interconnected systems are indisputable in a myriad of engineering fields, not only as business opportunities but also as a natural change towards efficiency, reliability, and scalability. In particular, mega-constellations of satellites promise to revolutionize the future of communications and Earth observation and monitoring. Although efforts towards the deployment of these solutions are underway, decades-old tried and tested individual ground-based tracking telemetry and command technologies condemn these ventures to practical unfeasibility and economic unviability. The goal of this thesis follows from the self-evident void in the state-of-the-art, aiming to bring these endeavors to fruition. First, the distributed and decentralized control problem is formulated in a receding horizon control framework alongside the severe large-scale feasibility constraints. Second, a convex relaxation procedure is proposed to approximate the optimal solution of the regulator synthesis problem in a decentralized setting, which is validated resorting to a large-scale numeric simulation and experimental results. Moreover, a tracking solution is put forward. Third, a novel distributed and decentralized networked control solution is developed for the particular case of dynamically decoupled systems. The controller synthesis computations are distributed across the network leveraging the proposed convex relaxation, an approximation, and a scheduling procedure, to comply with the feasibility constraints on a very large-scale. Fourth, the potential of the proposed solution is successfully illustrated for the cooperative on-board orbit control of the Starlink mega-constellation. The shape-keeping task is formulated in a novel framework with emphasis on efficiency and fuel saving.},

As a result, strategies based on a centralized framework are not scalable. The use of decentralized signal control strategies for large-scale urban traffic networks is a solution to this problem, since it allows for the implementation of such strategies on networks whose centralized solution is not easily scalable. This paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized traffic-responsive signal control solution, proposing two methods based on different formulations of the store-and-forward model: (i) the Decentralized Traffic-responsive Urban Control (DTUC) method; and (ii) the Decentralized Decoupled Traffic-responsive Urban Control (D2TUC). The decentralized configuration is such that each intersection is associated with one computational unit, with limited computational power and memory, which controls the traffic signals of the incoming links. Sufficient conditions for the controllability of the considered store-and-forward models are also presented. Both methods are validated resorting to numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, for two demand scenarios, and their performance is compared with the performance of the Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) centralized strategy. One of the proposed decentralized methods, D2TUC, is shown to match the performance of TUC.},
