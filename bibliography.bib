	abstract = {The transition from large centralized complex control systems to distributed configurations that rely on a network of a very large number of interconnected simpler subsystems is ongoing and inevitable in many applications. It is attributed to the quest for resilience, flexibility, and scalability in a multitude of engineering fields with far-reaching societal impact. Although many design methods for distributed and decentralized control systems are available, most of them rely on a centralized design procedure requiring some form of global information of the whole system. Clearly, beyond a certain scale of the network, these centralized design procedures for distributed controllers are no longer feasible and we refer to the corresponding systems as ultra large-scale systems (ULSS). For these ULSS, design algorithms are needed that are distributed themselves among the subsystems and are subject to stringent requirements regarding communication, computation, and memory usage of each subsystem. In this paper, a set of requirements is provided that assures a feasible real-time implementation of all phases of a control solution on an ultra large scale. State-of-the-art approaches are reviewed in the light of these requirements and the challenges hampering the development of befitting control algorithms are pinpointed. Comparing the challenges with the current progress leads to the identification and motivation of promising research directions.},

	abstract = {Most applied research exploring justice in the domain of transport has focused on the equity evaluation of existing systems. At the same time, most research on transport planning has been implementing conventional utilitarian paradigms, e.g., minimizing the average travel time of the population, without accounting for fairness. This paper aims to bridge this gap and adds to this literature in two ways: by exploring to what extent the application of different justice principles can enhance the fairness of the transport system; and by focusing on realizing such principles in the operation of transport systems rather than merely assessing a given system design. We use an intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) system as our case study, where a fleet of centrally controlled self-driving cars provides on-demand mobility synergistically with public transit and active modes (biking and walking). We explore how its operation can improve the situation of users that do not own a car. We first formally define a set of justice metrics that differ in terms of distributive principle and the good of concern. The metrics include: minimization of average travel time for the car-less population (i.e., a population-specific application of utilitarianism); avoidance of unacceptably long travel times for the car-less population in line with a sufficientarian approach; and delivery of reasonable travel times to a sufficient set of destinations. We showcase our framework in a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Our results show that, compared to conventional utilitarian minimum-travel-time planning, it is possible to significantly improve the situation of the car-less users without affecting conventional performance metrics such as average travel time. Whilst the differences between the proposed sufficientarian deployment models are rather modest, they highlight intrinsic crucial trade-offs that require further consideration and analysis. Overall, these results underscore the importance of taking a transdisciplinary approach addressing planning problems from conceptualization to modeling and optimization in transport and mobility.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an optimization framework for ride-pooling within Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems,whereby multi-occupancy self-driving robotaxis serve on-demand transportation requests. In particular, this works deals with ride-pooling taking into account both endogenous congestion created by the routing of the centrally controlled fleet, and exogenous traffic caused by self-interested private users. Specifically, we first define the general ride-pooling AMoD problem leveraging network flow models. Then, we devise multiple solution schemes. In particular we devise: i) a congestion-unaware ride-pooling matching between users, whereby users are matched together ignoring the state of congestion of the network; and ii) a congestion aware ride-pooling matching. In addition, we account for homogeneous and heterogeneous fleets with different number of passenger seats. The results indicate that the congestion-aware ride-pooling matching is significantly heavier from a computational point of view, but without a significant improvement of the performance compared to a congestion-unaware algorithm. Moreover, we show that the deployment of a heterogeneous fleet that serves pooled users and single users can outperform a fleet composed by just one vehicle type. The additional VHT caused by the additional rebalancing in the heterogeneous fleet compared to a homogeneous one are counter-balanced by the lower costs per VHT that can be achieved by deploying different type of vehicles. Last, we show that ride-pooling is crucial to decrease congestion in the network and average travel time experienced by the users. In particular, we study the performance of the system as a function of the AMoD penetration rate and ride-pooling penetration rate, highlighting that ride-pooling is fundamental to counter-balance the negative effects of rebalancing in an AMoD system.},

These robust strategies still require sensing infrastructure to implement traffic-responsiveness. In this paper, we take a novel perspective and show that it is possible to use the already necessary sensing infrastructure to estimate the uncertain quantities in real time. Specifically, resorting to the store-and-forward model, we design a novel network-wide traffic-responsive strategy that estimates the occupancy and exogenous demand in each link, i.e., entering (exiting) vehicle flows at the origins (destinations) of the network or within links, in real time. Borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback–feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations for the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, show that, for realistic surges in the exogenous demand, the proposed solution significantly outperforms tried-and-tested solutions that ignore the exogenous demand.},

	abstract = {When users access shared resources in a selfish manner, the resulting societal cost and perceived users' cost is often higher than what would result from a centrally coordinated optimal allocation. While several contributions in mechanism design manage to steer the aggregate users choices to the desired optimum by using monetary tolls, such approaches bear the inherent drawback of discriminating against users with a lower income. More recently, incentive schemes based on artificial currencies have been studied with the goal of achieving a system-optimal resource allocation that is also fair. In this resource-sharing context, this paper focuses on repeated weighted congestion game with two resources, where users contribute to the congestion to different extents that are captured by individual weights. First, we address the broad concept of fairness by providing a rigorous mathematical characterization of the distinct societal metrics of equity and equality, i.e., the concepts of providing equal outcomes and equal opportunities, respectively. Second, we devise weight-dependent and time-invariant optimal pricing policies to maximize equity and equality, and prove convergence of the aggregate user choices to the system-optimum. In our framework it is always possible to achieve system-optimal allocations with perfect equity, while the maximum equality that can be reached may not be perfect, which is also shown via numerical simulations.},

We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution.

Specifically, taking a mesoscopic time-invariant perspective and on the assumption of a large number of travel requests, we first cast the joint ride-pooling assignment and routing problem as a quadratic program that does not scale with the number of demands and can be solved with off-the-shelf convex solvers. Second, we compare the proposed approach with a significantly simpler decoupled formulation, whereby only the routing is performed in a congestion-aware fashion, whilst the ride-pooling assignment part is congestion-unaware. A case study of Sioux Falls reveals that such a simplification does not significantly alter the solution and that the decisive factor is indeed the congestion-aware routing. Finally, we solve the latter problem accounting for the presence of user-centered private vehicle users in a case study of Manhattan, NYC, characterizing the performance of the car-network as a function of AMoD penetration rate and percentage of pooled rides within it. Our results show that AMoD can significantly reduce congestion and travel times, but only if at least 40% of the users are willing to be pooled together. Otherwise, for higher AMoD penetration rates and low percentage of pooled rides, the effect of the additional rebalancing empty-vehicle trips can be even more detrimental than the benefits stemming from a centralized routing, worsening congestion and leading to an up to 15% higher average travel time.},

Each system is assumed to be modeled by linear time-varying dynamics, which can be leveraged to approximate nonlinear systems about successive points of operation. A distributed and decentralized receding horizon control solution is put forward, which: (i) takes communication delays into account; (ii) allows local communication exclusively; and (iii) whose computational and memory requirements in each computational unit do not scale with the dimension of the network. The scalability of the proposed solution enables emerging very large-scale applications of swarm robotics and networked control. This approach is applied to the orbit control problem of low Earth orbit mega-constellations, featuring high-fidelity numerical simulations for the Starlink mega-constellation.},

In this paper, we design a fair incentive mechanism to steer the selfish behavior of the users to align with the societally optimal aggregate routing. The proposed mechanism is based on an artificial currency that cannot be traded or bought, but only spent or received when traveling. Specifically, we consider a parallel-arc network with a single origin and destination node within a repeated game setting whereby each user chooses from one of the available arcs to reach their destination on a daily basis. In this framework, taking faster routes comes at a cost, whereas taking slower routes is incentivized by a reward. The users are thus playing against their future selves when choosing their present actions. To capture this complex behavior, we assume the users to be rational and to minimize an urgency-weighted combination of their immediate and future discomfort. To design the optimal pricing, we first derive a closed-form expression for the best individual response strategy. Second, we formulate the pricing design problem for each arc to achieve the societally optimal aggregate flows, and reformulate it so that it can be solved with gradient-free optimization methods. Our numerical simulations show that it is possible to achieve a near-optimal routing whilst significantly reducing the users' perceived discomfort when compared to a centralized optimal but urgency-unaware policy.},

In these type of models, the arrival process of travel requests is described by a Poisson process, meaning that there is only statistical insight into request times, including the probability that two requests may be pooled together. Taking advantage of this feature, we devise a method to capture ride-pooling from a stochastic mesoscopic perspective. This way, we are able to transform the original set of requests into an equivalent set including pooled ones which can be integrated within standard network flow problems, which in turn can be efficiently solved with off-the-shelf LP solvers for a given ride-pooling request assignment. Thereby, to compute such an assignment, we devise a polynomial-time algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. an approximated version of the problem. Finally, we perform a case study of Sioux Falls, USA, where we quantify the effects that waiting time and experienced delay have on the vehicle-hours traveled. Our results suggest that the higher the demands per unit time, the lower the waiting time and delay experienced by users. In addition, for a sufficiently large number of demands per unit time, with a maximum waiting time and experienced delay of 5 minutes, more than 90% of the requests can be pooled.},

	abstract = {The design of a decentralized and distributed filtering solution for large-scale networks of interconnected systems is addressed considering (i) generic nonlinear dynamics and (ii) generic coupled nonlinear outputs in a generic, possibly time-varying, topology. The local filters, which follow the structure of the extended Kalman filter, are implemented in each system, which estimates its own state exclusively. To be suitable for the heavily restricted implementation to very large-scale systems, a novel algorithm is proposed, which: (i) does not rely on instantaneous data transmission; (ii) allows local communication exclusively; and (iii) requires computational, memory, and data transmission resources for each system that do not scale with the dimension of the network. The scalability of the proposed algorithm allows for its application to the cooperative localization problem of very large-scale systems. In particular, it is applied herein to the on-board position estimation problem of LEO mega-constellations using GNSS featuring numerical simulations for the Starlink constellation.},

The problem is tackled in a novel moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework, while taking into account the limited communication capabilities and the restricted computational power and memory, which are distributed across the network. The proposed design is motivated by the fact that, in a decentralized setting, a Luenberguer-based framework is unable to leverage the full potential of the available local information. A method is derived to solve a relaxed version of the resulting optimization problem. It can be synthesized offline and its stability can be assessed prior to deployment. It is shown that the proposed approach allows for significant improvement on the performance of recent Luenberger-based filters. Furthermore, we show that a state-of-the-art distributed MHE solution with comparable requirements underperforms in comparison to the proposed solution.},

A general scheme is proposed, in which the problem is formulated as a classical linear quadratic regulator problem, for the global system, subject to a given sparsity constraint on the gain, which reflects the decentralized nature of the network. A method able to compute a sequence of well-performing stabilizing regulator gains is presented and validated resorting to simulations of two randomly generated LTV systems, one stable and the other unstable. Moreover, a tracking solution is developed, building on the solution to the regulator problem. Both methods rely on a closed-form solution, thus they can be computed very rapidly. Similarly to the centralized solution, both the presented methods require that a window of the future system dynamics is known. Both methods are validated resorting to simulations of: (i) a nonlinear network of four interconnected tanks; and (ii) a large-scale nonlinear network of interconnected tanks. When implemented to a nonlinear network, approximated by an LTV system, the proposed methods are able to compute well-performing gains that track the desired output. Finally, both algorithms are scalable, being adequate for implementation in large-scale networks.},

	abstract = {The advantages and tremendous potential of very large-scale complex networks of interconnected systems are indisputable in a myriad of engineering fields, not only as business opportunities but also as a natural change towards efficiency, reliability, and scalability. In particular, mega-constellations of satellites promise to revolutionize the future of communications and Earth observation and monitoring. Although efforts towards the deployment of these solutions are underway, decades-old tried and tested individual ground-based tracking telemetry and command technologies condemn these ventures to practical unfeasibility and economic unviability. The goal of this thesis follows from the self-evident void in the state-of-the-art, aiming to bring these endeavors to fruition. First, the distributed and decentralized control problem is formulated in a receding horizon control framework alongside the severe large-scale feasibility constraints. Second, a convex relaxation procedure is proposed to approximate the optimal solution of the regulator synthesis problem in a decentralized setting, which is validated resorting to a large-scale numeric simulation and experimental results. Moreover, a tracking solution is put forward. Third, a novel distributed and decentralized networked control solution is developed for the particular case of dynamically decoupled systems. The controller synthesis computations are distributed across the network leveraging the proposed convex relaxation, an approximation, and a scheduling procedure, to comply with the feasibility constraints on a very large-scale. Fourth, the potential of the proposed solution is successfully illustrated for the cooperative on-board orbit control of the Starlink mega-constellation. The shape-keeping task is formulated in a novel framework with emphasis on efficiency and fuel saving.},

	abstract = {Signal control strategies for congested urban road networks designed in a centralized framework require many communication links, serious processing power, and infrastructure for the centralized coordination. As a result, strategies based on a centralized framework are not scalable. The use of decentralized signal control strategies for large-scale urban traffic networks is a solution to this problem, since it allows for the implementation of such strategies on networks whose centralized solution is not easily scalable. This paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized traffic-responsive signal control solution, proposing two methods based on different formulations of the store-and-forward model: (i) the Decentralized Traffic-responsive Urban Control (DTUC) method; and (ii) the Decentralized Decoupled Traffic-responsive Urban Control (D2TUC). The decentralized configuration is such that each intersection is associated with one computational unit, with limited computational power and memory, which controls the traffic signals of the incoming links. Sufficient conditions for the controllability of the considered store-and-forward models are also presented. Both methods are validated resorting to numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, for two demand scenarios, and their performance is compared with the performance of the Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) centralized strategy. One of the proposed decentralized methods, D2TUC, is shown to match the performance of TUC.},
