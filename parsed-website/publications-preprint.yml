  abstract: "Research on the operation of mobility systems so far has mostly focused on minimizing cost-centered metrics such as average travel time, distance driven, and operational costs. Whilst capturing economic indicators, such metrics do not account for transportation justice aspects. In this paper, we present an optimization model to plan the operation of Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (I-AMoD) systems, where self-driving vehicles provide on-demand mobility jointly with public transit and active modes, with the goal to minimize the accessibility unfairness experienced by the population. Specifically, we first leverage a previously developed network flow model to compute the I-AMoD system operation in a minimum-time manner. Second, we formally define accessibility unfairness, and use it to frame the minimum-accessibility-unfairness problem and cast it as a linear program. We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution. Thereby we observe that the accessibility fairness of individual paths is, on average, worse than the average values obtained from flows, setting the stage for a discussion on the definition of accessibility fairness itself."

  abstract: "When users access shared resources in a selfish manner, the resulting societal cost and perceived users' cost is often higher than what would result from a centrally coordinated optimal allocation. While several contributions in mechanism design manage to steer the aggregate users choices to the desired optimum by using monetary tolls, such approaches bear the inherent drawback of discriminating against users with a lower income. More recently, incentive schemes based on artificial currencies have been studied with the goal of achieving a system-optimal resource allocation that is also fair. In this resource-sharing context, this paper focuses on repeated weighted congestion game with two resources, where users contribute to the congestion to different extents that are captured by individual weights. First, we address the broad concept of fairness by providing a rigorous mathematical characterization of the distinct societal metrics of equity and equality, i.e., the concepts of providing equal outcomes and equal opportunities, respectively. Second, we devise weight-dependent and time-invariant optimal pricing policies to maximize equity and equality, and prove convergence of the aggregate user choices to the system-optimum. In our framework it is always possible to achieve system-optimal allocations with perfect equity, while the maximum equality that can be reached may not be perfect, which is also shown via numerical simulations."

  abstract: "To cope with varying and highly uncertain traffic patterns, a novel network-wide traffic signal control strategy based on the store-and-forward model of a traffic network is proposed. On one hand, making use of a single loop detector in each road link, we develop an estimation solution for both the link occupancy and the net exogenous demand in every road link of a network. On the other hand, borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback-feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, show that, for realistic surges in the exogenous demand, the proposed solution significantly outperforms tried-and-tested solutions that ignore the exogenous demand."

  abstract: "This paper presents a framework to incorporate ride-pooling from a mesoscopic point of view, within time-invariant network flow models of Mobility-on-Demand systems. The resulting problem structure remains identical to a standard network flow model, a linear problem, which can be solved in polynomial time for a given ride-pooling request assignment. In order to compute such a ride-pooling assignment, we devise a polynomial-time knapsack-like algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. the minimum user travel time instance of the original problem. Finally, we conduct two case studies of Sioux Falls and Manhattan, where we validate our models against state-of-the-art time-varying results, and we quantitatively highlight the effects that maximum waiting time and maximum delay thresholds have on the vehicle hours traveled, overall pooled rides and actual delay experienced. We show that for a sufficient number of requests, with a maximum waiting time and delay of 5 minutes, it is possible to ride-pool more than 80% of the requests for both case studies. Last, allowing for four people ride-pooling can significantly boost the performance of the system."
