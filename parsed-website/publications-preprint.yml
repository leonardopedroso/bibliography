  abstract: "We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player’s chosen action. A player’s single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE."

  abstract: "We study a dynamic game with a large population of players who choose actions from a finite set in continuous time. Each player has a state in a finite state space that evolves stochastically with their actions. A player's reward depends not only on their own state and action but also on the distribution of states and actions across the population, capturing effects such as congestion in traffic networks. In Part I, we introduced an evolutionary model and a new solution concept - the mixed stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which coincides with the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model under meaningful families of revision protocols. In this second part, we investigate the evolutionary stability of MSNE. We derive conditions on both the structure of the MSNE and the game’s payoff map that ensure local and global stability under evolutionary dynamics. These results characterize when MSNE can robustly emerge and persist against strategic deviations, thereby providing insight into its long-term viability in large population dynamic games."

We propose an evolutionary model together with a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish strong approximation guarantees. We show that standard solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, and we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We analyze the relationship between MSNE and the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model and study the evolutionary stability of MSNE."
