  abstract: "To cope with varying and highly uncertain traffic patterns, a novel network-wide traffic signal control strategy based on the store-and-forward model of a traffic network is proposed. On one hand, making use of a single loop detector in each road link, we develop an estimation solution for both the link occupancy and the net exogenous demand in every road link of a network. On the other hand, borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback-feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, show that, for realistic surges in the exogenous demand, the proposed solution significantly outperforms tried-and-tested solutions that ignore the exogenous demand."

  abstract: "This paper presents a framework to incorporate ride-pooling from a mesoscopic point of view, within time-invariant network flow models of Mobility-on-Demand systems. The resulting problem structure remains identical to a standard network flow model, a linear problem, which can be solved in polynomial time for a given ride-pooling request assignment. In order to compute such a ride-pooling assignment, we devise a polynomial-time knapsack-like algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. the minimum user travel time instance of the original problem. Finally, we conduct two case studies of Sioux Falls and Manhattan, where we validate our models against state-of-the-art time-varying results, and we quantitatively highlight the effects that maximum waiting time and maximum delay thresholds have on the vehicle hours traveled, overall pooled rides and actual delay experienced. We show that for a sufficient number of requests, with a maximum waiting time and delay of 5 minutes, it is possible to ride-pool more than 80% of the requests for both case studies. Last, allowing for four people ride-pooling can significantly boost the performance of the system."

  abstract: "This paper presents a modeling and optimization framework to study congestion-aware ride-pooling Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, whereby self-driving robotaxis are providing on-demand mobility, and users headed in the same direction share the same vehicle for part of their journey. Specifically, taking a mesoscopic time-invariant perspective and on the assumption of a large number of travel requests, we first cast the joint ride-pooling assignment and routing problem as a quadratic program that does not scale with the number of demands and can be solved with off-the-shelf convex solvers. Second, we compare the proposed approach with a significantly simpler decoupled formulation, whereby only the routing is performed in a congestion-aware fashion, whilst the ride-pooling assignment part is congestion-unaware. A case study of Sioux Falls reveals that such a simplification does not significantly alter the solution and that the decisive factor is indeed the congestion-aware routing. Finally, we solve the latter problem accounting for the presence of user-centered private vehicle users in a case study of Manhattan, NYC, characterizing the performance of the car-network as a function of AMoD penetration rate and percentage of pooled rides within it. Our results show that AMoD can significantly reduce congestion and travel times, but only if at least 40% of the users are willing to be pooled together. Otherwise, for higher AMoD penetration rates and low percentage of pooled rides, the effect of the additional rebalancing empty-vehicle trips can be even more detrimental than the benefits stemming from a centralized routing, worsening congestion and leading to an up to 15% higher average travel time."
