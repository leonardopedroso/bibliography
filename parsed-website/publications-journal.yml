  abstract: "The transition from large centralized complex control systems to distributed configurations that rely on a network of a very large number of interconnected simpler subsystems is ongoing and inevitable in many applications. It is attributed to the quest for resilience, flexibility, and scalability in a multitude of engineering fields with far-reaching societal impact. Although many design methods for distributed and decentralized control systems are available, most of them rely on a centralized design procedure requiring some form of global information of the whole system. Clearly, beyond a certain scale of the network, these centralized design procedures for distributed controllers are no longer feasible and we refer to the corresponding systems as ultra large-scale systems (ULSS). For these ULSS, design algorithms are needed that are distributed themselves among the subsystems and are subject to stringent requirements regarding communication, computation, and memory usage of each subsystem. In this paper, a set of requirements is provided that assures a feasible real-time implementation of all phases of a control solution on an ultra large scale. State-of-the-art approaches are reviewed in the light of these requirements and the challenges hampering the development of befitting control algorithms are pinpointed. Comparing the challenges with the current progress leads to the identification and motivation of promising research directions."

  abstract: "To cope with uncertain traffic patterns and traffic models, traffic-responsive signal control strategies in the literature are designed to be robust to these uncertainties. These robust strategies still require sensing infrastructure to implement traffic-responsiveness. In this paper, we take a novel perspective and show that it is possible to use the already necessary sensing infrastructure to estimate the uncertain quantities in real time. Specifically, resorting to the store-and-forward model, we design a novel network-wide traffic-responsive strategy that estimates the occupancy and exogenous demand in each link, i.e., entering (exiting) vehicle flows at the origins (destinations) of the network or within links, in real time. Borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback–feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations for the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, show that, for realistic surges in the exogenous demand, the proposed solution significantly outperforms tried-and-tested solutions that ignore the exogenous demand."

  abstract: "This paper presents a framework to incorporate ride-pooling from a mesoscopic point of view, within time-invariant network flow models of Mobility-on-Demand systems. The resulting problem structure remains identical to a standard network flow model, a linear problem, which can be solved in polynomial time. In order to compute the ride-pooling assignment, which is the matching between two or more users so that they can be pooled together, we devise a polynomial-time knapsack-like algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. the minimum vehicle travel time with users on-board. Finally, we conduct two case studies of Sioux Falls and Manhattan, where we validate our models against state-of-the-art results, and we quantitatively highlight the effects that maximum waiting time and maximum delay thresholds have on the vehicle hours traveled, overall pooled rides and actual delay experienced. Last, we show that allowing for four people ride-pooling can significantly boost the performance of the system."

In this paper, the decentralized receding horizon control problem for very large-scale networks of dynamically decoupled systems with a common, possibly time-varying, control objective is addressed. Each system is assumed to be modeled by linear time-varying dynamics, which can be leveraged to approximate nonlinear systems about successive points of operation. A distributed and decentralized receding horizon control solution is put forward, which: (i) takes communication delays into account; (ii) allows local communication exclusively; and (iii) whose computational and memory requirements in each computational unit do not scale with the dimension of the network. The scalability of the proposed solution enables emerging very large-scale applications of swarm robotics and networked control. This approach is applied to the orbit control problem of low Earth orbit mega-constellations, featuring high-fidelity numerical simulations for the Starlink mega-constellation."

The problem is tackled in a novel moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework, while taking into account the limited communication capabilities and the restricted computational power and memory, which are distributed across the network. The proposed design is motivated by the fact that, in a decentralized setting, a Luenberguer-based framework is unable to leverage the full potential of the available local information. A method is derived to solve a relaxed version of the resulting optimization problem. It can be synthesized offline and its stability can be assessed prior to deployment. It is shown that the proposed approach allows for significant improvement on the performance of recent Luenberger-based filters. Furthermore, we show that a state-of-the-art distributed MHE solution with comparable requirements underperforms in comparison to the proposed solution."

As a means of reducing noise and measurement uncertainty propagation to a minimum, an expression for an optimal spatial sampling is derived. Furthermore, a baseline-free damage factor, allied with an optimal sampling, is also introduced. The proposed identification method is validated using experimental data of a beam. Using a damage localisation quality index, a comparison between the present method and one using finite differences is carried out, showing that the differentiation of spline interpolation leads to better damage identifications. The results obtained with the proposed approach show robustness and consistency in the localisations. Additionally, the hurdles of identifying small and multiple damage are tackled with the proposed method, yielding a good performance."

As a result, strategies based on a centralized framework are not scalable.

The decentralized configuration is such that each intersection is associated with one computational unit, with limited computational power and memory, which controls the traffic signals of the incoming links. Sufficient conditions for the controllability of the considered store-and-forward models are also presented. Both methods are validated resorting to numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, for two demand scenarios, and their performance is compared with the performance of the Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) centralized strategy. One of the proposed decentralized methods, D2TUC, is shown to match the performance of TUC."
