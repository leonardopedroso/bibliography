  abstract: "When users access shared resources in a selfish manner, the resulting societal cost and perceived users' cost is often higher than what would result from a centrally coordinated optimal allocation. While several contributions in mechanism design manage to steer the aggregate users choices to the desired optimum by using monetary tolls, such approaches bear the inherent drawback of discriminating against users with a lower income. More recently, incentive schemes based on artificial currencies have been studied with the goal of achieving a system-optimal resource allocation that is also fair. In this resource-sharing context, this paper focuses on repeated weighted congestion game with two resources, where users contribute to the congestion to different extents that are captured by individual weights. First, we address the broad concept of fairness by providing a rigorous mathematical characterization of the distinct societal metrics of equity and equality, i.e., the concepts of providing equal outcomes and equal opportunities, respectively. Second, we devise weight-dependent and time-invariant optimal pricing policies to maximize equity and equality, and prove convergence of the aggregate user choices to the system-optimum. In our framework it is always possible to achieve system-optimal allocations with perfect equity, while the maximum equality that can be reached may not be perfect, which is also shown via numerical simulations."

  abstract: "Research on the operation of mobility systems so far has mostly focused on minimizing cost-centered metrics such as average travel time, distance driven, and operational costs. Whilst capturing economic indicators, such metrics do not account for transportation justice aspects. In this paper, we present an optimization model to plan the operation of Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (I-AMoD) systems, where self-driving vehicles provide on-demand mobility jointly with public transit and active modes, with the goal to minimize the accessibility unfairness experienced by the population. Specifically, we first leverage a previously developed network flow model to compute the I-AMoD system operation in a minimum-time manner. Second, we formally define accessibility unfairness, and use it to frame the minimum-accessibility-unfairness problem and cast it as a linear program. We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution. Thereby we observe that the accessibility fairness of individual paths is, on average, worse than the average values obtained from flows, setting the stage for a discussion on the definition of accessibility fairness itself."

  abstract: "This paper presents a modeling and optimization framework to study congestion-aware ride-pooling Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, whereby self-driving robotaxis are providing on-demand mobility, and users headed in the same direction share the same vehicle for part of their journey. Specifically, taking a mesoscopic time-invariant perspective and on the assumption of a large number of travel requests, we first cast the joint ride-pooling assignment and routing problem as a quadratic program that does not scale with the number of demands and can be solved with off-the-shelf convex solvers. Second, we compare the proposed approach with a significantly simpler decoupled formulation, whereby only the routing is performed in a congestion-aware fashion, whilst the ride-pooling assignment part is congestion-unaware. A case study of Sioux Falls reveals that such a simplification does not significantly alter the solution and that the decisive factor is indeed the congestion-aware routing. Finally, we solve the latter problem accounting for the presence of user-centered private vehicle users in a case study of Manhattan, NYC, characterizing the performance of the car-network as a function of AMoD penetration rate and percentage of pooled rides within it. Our results show that AMoD can significantly reduce congestion and travel times, but only if at least 40% of the users are willing to be pooled together. Otherwise, for higher AMoD penetration rates and low percentage of pooled rides, the effect of the additional rebalancing empty-vehicle trips can be even more detrimental than the benefits stemming from a centralized routing, worsening congestion and leading to an up to 15% higher average travel time."

  abstract: "Within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested users can lead to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum which could be achieved by centrally controlling the users' choices. In this paper, we design a fair incentive mechanism to steer the selfish behavior of the users to align with the societally optimal aggregate routing. The proposed mechanism is based on an artificial currency that cannot be traded or bought, but only spent or received when traveling. Specifically, we consider a parallel-arc network with a single origin and destination node within a repeated game setting whereby each user chooses from one of the available arcs to reach their destination on a daily basis. In this framework, taking faster routes comes at a cost, whereas taking slower routes is incentivized by a reward. The users are thus playing against their future selves when choosing their present actions. To capture this complex behavior, we assume the users to be rational and to minimize an urgency-weighted combination of their immediate and future discomfort. To design the optimal pricing, we first derive a closed-form expression for the best individual response strategy. Second, we formulate the pricing design problem for each arc to achieve the societally optimal aggregate flows, and reformulate it so that it can be solved with gradient-free optimization methods. Our numerical simulations show that it is possible to achieve a near-optimal routing whilst significantly reducing the users' perceived discomfort when compared to a centralized optimal but urgency-unaware policy."

  abstract: "This paper presents a time-invariant network flow model capturing two-person ride-pooling that can be integrated within design and planning frameworks for Mobility-on-Demand systems. In these type of models, the arrival process of travel requests is described by a Poisson process, meaning that there is only statistical insight into request times, including the probability that two requests may be pooled together. Taking advantage of this feature, we devise a method to capture ride-pooling from a stochastic mesoscopic perspective. This way, we are able to transform the original set of requests into an equivalent set including pooled ones which can be integrated within standard network flow problems, which in turn can be efficiently solved with off-the-shelf LP solvers for a given ride-pooling request assignment. Thereby, to compute such an assignment, we devise a polynomial-time algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. an approximated version of the problem. Finally, we perform a case study of Sioux Falls, USA, where we quantify the effects that waiting time and experienced delay have on the vehicle-hours traveled. Our results suggest that the higher the demands per unit time, the lower the waiting time and delay experienced by users. In addition, for a sufficiently large number of demands per unit time, with a maximum waiting time and experienced delay of 5 minutes, more than 90% of the requests can be pooled."

  abstract: "This paper aims to explore a new technique for structural damage identification using cubic spline interpolation. The method is based on the interpolation of modal rotations measured with speckle shearography. In order to locate the damaged areas, we make use of the analytical derivative of the cubic spline function to compute the modal curvature, which is known to be very sensitive to damage. A comprehensive parametric study of the spatial sampling interval is carried out to find its influence on noise filtering. Furthermore, the identification quality dependency on the mode shape and respective noise is also examined. The results obtained with the proposed method show the consistency of the localizations. Additionally, the challenging tasks of identifying small and multiple damage are tackled, yielding a good performance."
